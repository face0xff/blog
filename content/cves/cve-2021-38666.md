* [MSRC Report: Remote Desktop Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-38666)
* CVSS 8.8 (*Critical*)

## Summary

In Microsoft Remote Desktop, a malicious RDP server could remotely execute code in a client through the RDPDR extension (enabled by default).

This affected many versions of Windows, including Windows 11 and 10.

## Details

The vulnerability lied in the smart card extension of the RDPDR virtual channel. A malicious server could ask the client to perform an IOCTL call through a carefully serialized RPC message. During the deserialization process, a misuse of the RPC NDR mashalling engine led to a heap-based buffer overflow.

More details available in a [dedicated article over on Thalium's blog](https://thalium.github.io/blog/posts/deserialization-bug-through-rdp-smart-card-extension/).

I also explained this vulnerability during a conference talk at SSTIC 2022: [Fuzzing Microsoft's RDP Client using Virtual Channels](https://www.sstic.org/2022/presentation/fuzzing_microsofts_rdp_client_using_virtual_channels/).
