  <h2>CVEs</h2>
  
  <p>
  Although I am only starting out and I don't have a lot of experience, I have done some vulnerability research professionally.
  This page lists all the vulnerabilities I have found as part of my research
  that were assigned a CVE ID, with technical details of variable length.
  Some of these were awarded bounties.
