title: "About me"
---

I am a security analyst and reverse engineer from France.

I love computer science, security and challenges. I am especially drawn to fields such as offensive security, reverse engineering, binary exploitation and cryptography. I love learning and sharing my knowledge.

Previously, I have played CTFs with [SHRECS](https://ctftime.org/team/89273), a team that I created with fellow students of my university.
During that time, we helped promoting the CTF culture in CentraleSup√©lec, and won multiple competitions such as Imperial CTF, HackDay, THCon CTF and Orange CTF.

I have also been part of [ECSC Team France](https://ctftime.org/team/159269) for four years in a row,
including when we finished 3rd place in European Cyber Security Challenge 2022 (Vienna edition).

You can hit me up on Discord @face0xff.
