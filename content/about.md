title: "About me"
---

I am a french student in engineering and cybersecurity.

I love computer science, security and challenges. I am especially drawn to fields such as offensive security, reverse engineering and cryptography. I love learning and sharing my knowledge.

As a huge CTF enthusiast, I created [SHRECS](https://shrecs.fr/), a team with fellow students of my university.
We're not the best, nor do we have much free time to do plenty of competitions together, but we're having fun.

You can hit me up on Discord @face0xff#7693.
