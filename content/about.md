title: "About me"
---

I am a security researcher at [Thalium](https://thalium.re).

I specialize in reverse engineering and vulnerability research. I am interested in low level security, fuzzing, binary exploitation techniques and mitigations. I also enjoy cryptography.

Previously, I have played CTFs with [SHRECS](https://ctftime.org/team/89273), a team that I created with fellow students of my university. During that time, we helped promoting the CTF culture in CentraleSup√©lec, and won multiple competitions such as Imperial CTF, HackDay, THCon CTF and Orange CTF.

I have also been part of [ECSC Team France](https://ctftime.org/team/159269) for four years in a row,
including when we finished 3rd place in European Cyber Security Challenge 2022 (Vienna edition).

You can hit me up on Discord @face0xff.
